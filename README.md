# Welcome to phortheman's GitHub page
## About me
My Internet alias is phortheman ( four the man ). Its a cheesy name that my mother helped me come up with when making my first email address ages ago. 

I am a self taught C++ software engineer and I am currently practicing writting Python along with some other languages. 

## What is here?

- A rather large project on my GitHub is my [NGTCKubeJS](https://github.com/phortheman/NGTCKubeJS) project for a personal Minecraft server I'm playing with my friends. It acts as a backup for the scripts I made to change certain aspects of the game that we felt needed tweaking.

- I also have a repo I used to track the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021 I took part in up to day 4. I'm planning on taking part in it for 2022 and hope to kee up with it as long as my schedule permits it

 - Another fun project on here is my recreation of a mini game [Knuckle bones](https://github.com/phortheman/KnuckleBonesPython) from the game The Cult of the Lamb. Its played in ther terminal and is written in Python. My favorite feature from it is the terminal refresh funtion I implemented that will clear the terminal before displaying what the boards look like. It make the whole playing in the terminal experience much better.

- There is also a catch all repo that has some very small Python projects I did as exercises to practice Python. The more notiable one is the palindrome script but aside from that they are mostly just super small and quick projects.
