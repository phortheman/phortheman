# Welcome to phortheman's GitHub page
I am a self-taught C++ Software Engineer who is interested in learning lower-level languages like Rust and Go, but I also enjoy creating automation tools using high-level languages like Python.

Currently I am using Go to create CLI apps to assist developers at my day job.

## About me
My internet alias is phortheman ("four the man"). It's a cheesy name that my mother helped me come up with when I created my first email address ages ago. My real name is Marcus. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a minor in Business.

## What's here?

- My [NeoVim config](https://github.com/phortheman/nvim). Ever evolving, loving it.

- My solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://github.com/phortheman/AdventOfCode_2023) written in Go. I used this to practice the language before I started to make tools for work.

- My Attempt to the [1brc](https://github.com/phortheman/1brc_go) which is a very fun and functional challenge where you need to aggregate 1 billion rows of data.

- I made a test [Discord bot](https://github.com/phortheman/Steam_Group_Queue_Discord_Bot) that takes Steam URLs and stores it into a wishlist using a Postgres database. Super experimental to familiarize myself with Postgres and to practice setting up Docker Compose and hosting on my Raspberry PI. The idea is a server user could create a wishlist either in a text channel or in a thread and others could add games they are interested in. Then they could list them all out easily to discuss in a voice channel.

- My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/phortheman/AdventOfCode_2022) for 2022. All solutions are written in Python. I first learned Python 2 in high school, and I knew I wanted to create some automation tools for work, so I used the Advent of Code to practice the language.

 - I recreation of a mini-game called [Knuckle bones](https://github.com/phortheman/KnuckleBonesPython) from the game "The Cult of the Lamb". It's played in the terminal and is written in Python. My favorite feature is the terminal refresh function I implemented, which clears the terminal before displaying the board. It significantly improved the playing experience in the terminal.

 - Another significant project on my GitHub is [NGTCKubeJS](https://github.com/phortheman/NGTCKubeJS), which is for a personal Minecraft server I played with my friends. It serves as a backup for the scripts I created to modify certain aspects of the game that we felt needed tweaking.
