# Welcome to phortheman's GitHub page
I am a self-taught C++ Software Engineer who is interested in learning lower-level languages like Rust and Go, but I also enjoy creating automation tools using high-level languages like Python.

Currently I am working on a Discord bot to help me and my friends manage the next Steam sale written in Python and I am doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2023 in Go

## About me
My internet alias is phortheman ("four the man"). It's a cheesy name that my mother helped me come up with when I created my first email address ages ago. My real name is Marcus. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a minor in Business.

## What's here?

- I've created a repository to track the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2022. All solutions are written in Python. I first learned Python 2 in high school, and I knew I wanted to create some automation tools for work, so I used the Advent of Code to practice the language.

 - A fun project on here is my recreation of a mini-game called [Knuckle bones](https://github.com/phortheman/KnuckleBonesPython) from the game "The Cult of the Lamb". It's played in the terminal and is written in Python. My favorite feature is the terminal refresh function I implemented, which clears the terminal before displaying the board. It significantly improved the playing experience in the terminal.

 - Another significant project on my GitHub is [NGTCKubeJS](https://github.com/phortheman/NGTCKubeJS), which is for a personal Minecraft server I played with my friends. It serves as a backup for the scripts I created to modify certain aspects of the game that we felt needed tweaking.
